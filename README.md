IMPORTANT NOTE -
This project does not have a mongoDB connection setup. Setup the connection based on the environments below.

local development: create a config file (make sure to name it connection.ts) in the db folder, which exports your db connection.
production: Since the config file is not pushed when you deploy your app, you must specifiy your db url in heroku. Set the url in heroku as specified in this resource. Make sure you name the environement variable "MONGODB_URL".
